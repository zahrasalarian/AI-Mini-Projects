# AI-Mini-Projects
## First project
The purpose of this project was to identify breast cancer in patients by using various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, SVM with linear kernel, SVM with RBF kernel, Decision Tree, and KNN.  
For the implementation of these algorithms, I used the scikit-learn library, followed by the k-fold cross validation method to assess their accuracy.  
First, to gain a better understanding of the data, I plotted single-feature diagrams and their feature pairs, and then I fitted the models to the data.
